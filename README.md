# Personalized-Wellness-Insights-with-Deep-Learning-approach
The Personalized Wellness Insights model can be significantly enhanced by integrating a deep learning approach, allowing for more sophisticated analysis and personalized recommendations for yoga practitioners.

Overview of the Enhanced Model
Objective: The goal is to create a deep learning-powered personalized wellness insights model that generates tailored health reports based on user data, such as pose proficiency, session duration, and engagement levels, while leveraging advanced neural network techniques for improved accuracy and insights.

A.Data Generation Synthetic Data Creation: A synthetic dataset is generated to simulate user interactions with yoga sessions. Key attributes include:

1.User ID: Unique identifier for each user.

2.Session Duration: Duration of yoga sessions in minutes.

3.Pose Proficiency: Scores representing proficiency in various yoga poses (0-100 scale).

4.Engagement: A score reflecting user interaction and commitment to the practice (0-100 scale).

5.User Feedback: Textual feedback from users about their experience, which can be analyzed using natural language processing (NLP).

B.Model Development Deep Learning Model: A neural network is designed to analyze user data and generate personalized reports. The model architecture include:

1.Input Layer: Accepts features such as session duration, pose proficiency, engagement, and user feedback.

2.Hidden Layers: Multiple layers to capture complex patterns in the data.

3.Output Layer: Generates insights such as recommendations for improvement and predicted future engagement levels.

C.Report Generation Function: A function is created to generate personalized reports for each user. The report includes:

1.Average Session Duration: Mean duration of yoga sessions.

2.Average Engagement: Mean engagement score.

3.Average Pose Proficiency: Mean scores for each pose, providing insights into strengths and weaknesses.

4.Personalized Recommendations: Suggestions based on deep learning analysis, such as specific poses to focus on or adjustments to session duration.

D.Implementation: The model processes user data to compute averages and generate insights, utilizing techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to improve performance.

E.Integration with a Yoga App Flask API: A simple API is created using Flask to simulate integration with a yoga app. Users can request their personalized wellness insights by accessing a specific endpoint with their User ID.

The API returns a JSON response containing the user's report, including deep learning-generated insights.
